## Usage Llama_pop_Growth

To use this program, simply compile the `Lama_Pop_Growth.c` file and run the resulting executable. The program will prompt the user to enter the starting population of llamas and the target population. Once the user has entered these values, the program will calculate the number of years it would take to reach the target population using the following formula:

```
n = current_population
Years_amount = n + (n / 3) - (n / 4)
```
where each year, (n / 3) new llamas are born, and (n / 4) llamas pass away

The program will repeat the above formula until the new population is greater than or equal to the target population. It will then output the number of years it would take to reach the target population.
