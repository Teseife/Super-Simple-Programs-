This repository is a compilation of programs that perform simple program solutions for Harvards CS50x class.

# Simple Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple programs that perform various tasks. Each program is written in C programming language and can be compiled and run on any platform that supports C.

## Programs

The following programs are included in this repository:

- **Llama_Pop_Growth:**This program calculates the number of years it would take to reach a specified population of llamas. The program uses a simple formula that takes into account the number of llamas born and passed in a given year. 

- **encrypt_text:** This program encrypts a given text using a simple substitution cipher. The user can provide a key that defines the mapping between plaintext characters and ciphertext characters.

- **decrypt_text:** This program decrypts a given ciphertext using a simple substitution cipher. The user must provide the same key that was used to encrypt the plaintext.

- **count_words:** This program counts the number of words in a given text. A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by whitespace.

- **reverse_string:** This program reverses a given string. For example, the string "hello" would be reversed to "olleh".

## Usage

To use these programs, you must have a C compiler installed on your system. You can then compile each program by running the following command:

```
gcc -o <output_file> <input_file.c>
```

Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the output file you want to create, and `<input_file.c>` with the name of the input file containing the program code.

Once you have compiled a program, you can run it by executing the output file:

```
./<output_file>
```

Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the output file you compiled earlier.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or improvements for any of these programs, feel free to submit a pull request.
