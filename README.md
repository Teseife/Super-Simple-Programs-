# Simple Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple programs that perform various tasks. Each program is written in C programming language and can be compiled and run on any platform that supports C.

## Programs

The following programs are included in this repository:

- **Llama_Pop_Growth:** This program calculates the number of years it would take to reach a specified population of llamas. The program uses a simple formula that takes into account the number of llamas born and passed in a given year. Source Code [Llama_Pop_Growth](https://github.com/Teseife/Super-Simple-Programs-/blob/main/Programs/Llama_Pop_Growth.c)

- **ShiftCypher:** This program encrypts a given text using a formula that shifts letters and outputs the encrypted text. The user inputs a shift key, which is an integer that represents the number of positions each letter should be shifted. The program will then prompt the user to enter the plaintext message to be encrypted. Once the user enters the plaintext, the program will output the ciphertext message. Source Code [ShiftCypher](https://github.com/Teseife/Super-Simple-Programs-/blob/main/Programs/ShiftCypher.c)

- **SubstitutionCipher:** This program encrypts a given text using a simple substitution cipher. The user can provide a key that defines the mapping between plaintext characters and ciphertext characters. Source Code [SubistutuitonCipher](https://github.com/Teseife/Super-Simple-Programs-/blob/main/Programs/SubstitutionCipher.c)

- **WordScoringGame:** This program allows two players to enter words and calculates the scores for each word based on a predefined scoring system. The player with the higher score wins the game. Source Code [WordScoringGame](https://github.com/Teseife/Super-Simple-Programs-/blob/main/Programs/WordScoringGame.c)

- **VolumeScale:** VolumeScale is a simple program that allows you to modify the volume of a WAV audio file. This program is written in C and can be used as a command-line tool. Source Code [VolumeScale](https://github.com/Teseife/Super-Simple-Programs-/blob/main/Programs/VolumeScale.c)

- **GeneInheritance:** simulates the genetic inheritance of blood types for a family tree structure. It represents a person with a struct, where each person has two parents and two alleles. The alleles represent the blood type of the person. Source Code: [GeneInheritance.c](https://github.com/Teseife/Super-Simple-Programs-/blob/main/Programs/GeneInhertiance.c)

- **reverse_string:** This program reverses a given string. For example, the string "hello" would be reversed to "olleh". Source Code[]

## Usage

To use these programs, you must have a C compiler installed on your system.
