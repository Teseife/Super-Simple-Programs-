This repository is a compilation of programs that perform simple program solutions for Harvards CS50x class.

# Simple Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple programs that perform various tasks. Each program is written in C programming language and can be compiled and run on any platform that supports C.

## Programs

The following programs are included in this repository:

- **Llama_Pop_Growth:** This program calculates the number of years it would take to reach a specified population of llamas. The program uses a simple formula that takes into account the number of llamas born and passed in a given year. 

- **ShiftCypher:** This program encrypts a given text using a formula that shifts letters and outputs the encrypted text. The user inputs a shift key, which is an integer that represents the number of positions each letter should be shifted. The program will then prompt the user to enter the plaintext message to be encrypted. Once the user enters the plaintext, the program will output the ciphertext message.

- **SubstitutionCipher:** This program encrypts a given text using a simple substitution cipher. The user can provide a key that defines the mapping between plaintext characters and ciphertext characters.

- **WordScoringGame:**This program allows two players to enter words and calculates the scores for each word based on a predefined scoring system. The player with the higher score wins the game.

- **reverse_string:** This program reverses a given string. For example, the string "hello" would be reversed to "olleh".

## Usage

To use these programs, you must have a C compiler installed on your system. You can then compile each program by running the following command:

```
gcc -o <output_file> <input_file.c>
```

Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the output file you want to create, and `<input_file.c>` with the name of the input file containing the program code.

Once you have compiled a program, you can run it by executing the output file:

```
./<output_file>
```

Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the output file you compiled earlier.

## Further usage

An indepth explanaiton of the programs is avalable in the `<Program Details.md>` file under `<Programs>`file.
